    "\n",
    "• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.   \n",
    "\n",
    "• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.  \n",
    " \n",
    "• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.   \n",
    "\n",
    "• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n"

    "The phenonom I have chosen is new gratuate salaries in Ireland. I chose this subject because...\n",
    "The expected results of this project will be to simulate a data set of graduate salaries based on a number of contributing factors as detailed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data released by the CSO (https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-heo/highereducationoutcomes-graduationyears2010-2019/backgroundstatistics/) shows that in 2019 there were over 42,000 new college graduates in Ireland. \n",
    "The numbers of new college graduates in Ireland has been on the increase for a number of years now with Ireland having a higher than the EU average of people with 3rd level education hitting a peak of 61% of 25-34 year olds having a 3rd level education on 2020 (https://www.cso.ie/en/csolatestnews/pressreleases/2021pressreleases/pressstatementeducationalattainmentthematicreport2021/). \n",
    "A report by Trinity News in 2022 (https://trinitynews.ie/2022/10/ireland-ranked-third-among-oecd-countries-for-rate-of-third-level-education/) shows that Ireland was ranked 3rd amongst the 38 OECD countries for 3rd level attainment overall. And that 63% of those in the 18-22 year old category were in 3rd level education compared to the EU average of 59%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, data from HEA (https://hea.ie/statistics/graduate-outcomes-data-and-reports/graduate-outcomes-2021/) shows that over three quarters ended up in employment with (6?) months with approx. 20% going on to furth study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of those that were in employment, 91% were working in Ireland with the breakdown of:   \n",
    "43% working in Dublin (Dublin region)   \n",
    "15% working in Cork (South West Region)   \n",
    "7% working in Galway (Mid West Region)   \n",
    "35% split across the remaining 5 regions (Mid East, South East, West, Border, Midlands).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data clearly shows that more and more young people are attending and graduating from 3rd level education. An article by Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/why-should-you-go-to-college/) indicates that the primary reason for going to college is to earn more money with college graduates out earning those who finished education at secondary level by as much as almost 50% annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will focus only on those who graduated with a level 8 Hons degree and fall into the category of new/young graduate. These ranged across a number of NFQ levels from Level 6 through to Level 10. Of these, Level 8 Hons degrees were by far the most popular with over 28,000 (xx%).

More recent research by the Irish Independent (https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/surge-in-graduate-employment-as-four-in-five-walk-into-a-job-with-average-salary-of-38044/42166132.html) show the average salary for new graduates is now 38,044. An article by The Irish Times (https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2022/11/23/college-graduates-gain-employment-in-record-numbers/) indicates that the average earnings for all graduates were just over €38,000. \n",
    "Graduate salaries have increased steadily over the last 10 years with research published by the CSO (https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-heo/highereducationoutcomes-graduationyears2010-2019/whatdograduatesearn/) showing a yearly increase generally in line with inflation on average.\n",

A study by gradireland (https://gradireland.com/careers-advice/job-offers-and-working-life/salaries-and-benefits-new-graduates) also claims the importance of location/region as being a factor influencing salary.\n",
