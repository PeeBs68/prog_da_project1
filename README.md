### Requirements
(detail the requirements here)


### Methods
(detail my approach here)

The first thing to do was to decide on a real-world phenomonen for my project. After much thinking I finally decided to base my project on the subject of new graduate salaries in Ireland. This topic as it is of interest to me as I have two children who recently graduated college and have both started working - albeit in completely different industries.

Graduate salaries tend to vary quite significantly and there is much researh and data available on this topic. Different sources tend to give different figures so finding trustworthy sources was an important aspect of my research. My primary sources of data to start to understand the phenonomen were gov.ie $^1$ and also the HEA $^2$. 

#### Variable1 - salary
From the HEA website I was able to find the average new graduate salary in Ireland. 
(describe it here - continuous varibale measuered in etc...)


(move this bit to below somewhere)
Combining details from both gov.ie and HEA I was able to calculate the average salary across the different regions brokedn down by both industry sector and grade achieved...

#### Variable2 - grade
gov.ie also shows the average salary by grade achieved...

#### Variable2 - area of study
gov.ie also shows the average salary by area of study...

#### Variable4 - location
