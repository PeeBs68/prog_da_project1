# **Programming for Data Analysis**
***

This repository contains a Jupyter noyebook titled **'project1.ipynb'** which creates a data set to simulate a real world phenomenon and perform statistical analysis on it.

## **Overview**

The purpose of this notebook is to perform statistical analysis on a real world phenomenon. 

This notebook walks through the process of:
1. **Choosing** a real world phenomenon that can be measured and for which we could collect 100 data points across at least four different variables.
2. Investigating the types of variables involved, their likely **distributions**, and their **relationships** with each other.
3. **Synthesising/simulating** a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
4. Display the newly created data set using histograms and bar charts

## **Requirements**

To run the analysis in this notebook, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `random`

You can install these dependencies using 'pip':

```bash
pip install pandas, numpy, matplotlib, random
```

Alternatively you can install all the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

### **Steps to Run the Analysis**

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PeeBs68/prog_da_project1
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook project1.ipynb
```

4. Open the notebook in you browser and run the cells to perform the analysis

### **Notebook Workflow**

The **project1.ipynb** notebook follows these key steps

#### 1. **Initial Research**
    - Decide on a phenomenon to investigate
    - Identify sources of data 
    - Identify variables to analyse

#### 2. **Simulation**
    - Build initial data sets
    - Apply required filters and updates as deemed approproate

#### 3. **Results**
    - Display the results using appropriate plots such as histograms and bar charts
    - Discuss results
    - Confirm/validate findings
